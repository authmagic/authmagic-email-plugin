Magic link
-----------
To check the identity of the user it is possible to send to his email, phone or any other resource he owns an authorization link. By clicking on that link user identifies himself as an owner of the resource. You can see many apps who suggest this option, for example <a href="https://medium.com/">medium.com</a> and <a href="https://auth0.com/">auth0.com</a>.
